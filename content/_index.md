I am a Professor of Systems Engineering in the Department of Electrical and
Electronic Engineering at the University of Melbourne. Before this, I served as
Professor of Mechatronics Engineering in the School of Engineering at the
Australian National University from 2021 to 2025. Between 2019 and 2021, I was
an Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical and Electronic
Engineering at the University of Melbourne, where I also worked as a Senior
Lecturer and McKenzie Fellow from 2012 to 2017. From 2011 to 2012, I was a
Postdoctoral Researcher at the ACCESS Linnaeus Centre, KTH Royal Institute of
Technology. I earned my Ph.D. in Engineering and Computer Science from the
Australian National University in 2011, after completing a B.Sc. in Electrical
and Electronics Engineering at Shiraz University in 2006.

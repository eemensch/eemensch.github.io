I am currently a Professor of Mechatronics at the School of Engineering at the Australian National University. Previously, I had been an Associate Professor at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, the University of Melbourne from 2014 to 2020 and a Senior Lecturer and a McKenzie fellow at the same department from 2012 to 2014 and before that I was an ACCESS Postdoctoral Researcher at the ACCESS Linnaeus Centre, the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. I received my B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from Shiraz University in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in engineering and computer science from the Australian National University, Canberra, Australia in 2011.

See my CV and the Research Projects page for more information. To check current research fellow (postdoctoral) and PhD scholarship  positions check Open Positions.

  <p>I am currently a Professor of Mechatronics at the School of Engineering at the
Australian National University. Previously, I had been an Associate Professor at
the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, the University of
Melbourne from 2014 to 2020 and a Senior Lecturer and a McKenzie fellow at the
same department from 2012 to 2014 and before that I was an ACCESS Postdoctoral
Researcher at the ACCESS Linnaeus Centre, the KTH Royal Institute of Technology,
Stockholm, Sweden. I received my B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from
Shiraz University in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in engineering and computer
science from the Australian National University, Canberra, Australia in 2011.</p>
<p>See my CV and the Research Projects page for more information. To check current
research fellow (postdoctoral) and PhD scholarship  positions check Open
Positions.  Prospective Students</p>
<p>I am always looking for good students with degrees in electrical and electronic
engineering, computer science, applied mathematics, or mechanical engineering
with solid background in mathematics and particularly in numerical methods,
differential equations, control theory, nonlinear programming, and optimisation.
Students interested in doing their PhD in the general areas of systems theory,
optimisation, control or any of the areas listed below should email me their
expressions of interest along with their CV.</p>
